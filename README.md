# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this project as a study guide for my web development bootcamp. It is a webpage that compiles all my notes from the modules, articles and video lectures in the pre-work. I learned how to make framework in HTML, style in CSS, and add functionality in JavaScript.

This study guide can be used by reviewing the notes in each section. The user can open Chrome DevTools for a suggestion on which to study first by right clicking on an element and selecting 'Inspect'. The console tab will show the JavaScript running aand provide the user with a study suggestion, as well as a list of all the topics covered in pre-work.
